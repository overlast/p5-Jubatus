=head1 NAME

Jubatus::Stat::Client - Perl extension for interfacing with recommendation server 'jubastat'

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Jubatus;

    my $cluster_name = "jubatus_perl_doc";
    # even if it isn't in a distributed environment using ZooKeeper and Jubatus keepers.

    my $host_name_or_ip_address = "localhost"; # master node's
    my $port_number_of_juba_process = 13714; # meanless

    my $juba_client_type = "stat";
    # you can select from (recommender|regression|clasifier|stat|graph|anomaly)

    my $reco_client = Jubatus->get_client($host_name_or_ip_address, $port_number_of_juba_process, $juba_client_type);
    # got Jubatus::Stat::Client object

    # In the following example, get maximum value from sample array using Jubatus::Stat::Client object

    my $is_clear = $reco_client->clear($cluster_name);

    my @sample = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);
    my $key = "sum";
    foreach my $val (@sample) {
        my $is_push = $stat_client->push($cluster_name, $key, $val);
    }
    my $result = $stat_client->sum($cluster_name, $key);

    # $result equal 15.0

This code will create Jubatus::Stat::Client object and return it.
You should set $host and $port in agreement to running jubastat server apprication.

    use Jubatus;
    my $host = 'localhost';
    my $port = '13714';
    my $juba_client_type = 'stat';
