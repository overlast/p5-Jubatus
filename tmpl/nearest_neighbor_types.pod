=head1 NAME

Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Types - Perl extension for treating a data structure
to use interface of recommendation server 'jubanearest_neighbor'

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Types;

    # If you want to any Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::* packages,
    # all one need to do is write "use Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Types;"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provide the constructors and the methods to use interface of
recommendation server 'jubanearest_neighbor'.

=head1 METHODS

Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Types will provide many packages and constructors, methods.
These are used in Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Clients.

See L<Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Client> for more detail.

=head2 Packages

=head3 Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Datum

If you want to use this package, all one need to do is write "use Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Types;"

=head4 Constructors

=head5 Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Datum->new($string_values, $num_values);

Input:

    - $string_values is a array reference which are allowed to locate many array
      references. Each of located arrry references should have two string
      value which are called "key" and "value".

    - $num_values is a array reference which are allowed to locate many array
      references. Each of located arrry references should have two values.
      First string value which are called "key" and second float value which
      are called "value".

Output:

    - Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Datum object.

      This object have two fields.
      'string_values' field locate the array reference which was inputed as
      $string_values in constructor.
      'num_values' field locate the array reference which was inputed as
      $num_values in constructor.

=head4 Functions

=head5 to_msgpack->()

Input:

    - None

Output:

    - A array reference

      This array reference locate $string_values and $num_values which are given
      in constructor.

      This array reference certainly locate two array references. First
      reference are allowed to locate many array references. Each of located
      arrry references should have two string value which are called "key"
      and "value". Second reference are allowed to locate many array references.
      Each of located arrry references should have two values. First string
      value which are called "key" and second float value which are called
      "value".

=head5 from_msgpack->($return_value_from_msgpack)

Input:

    - $return_value_from_msgpack is a array reference.

      This array reference certainly locate two array references. First
      reference are allowed to locate many array references. Each of located
      arrry references should have two string value which are called "key"
      and "value". Second reference are allowed to locate many array references.
      Each of located arrry references should have two values. First string
      value which are called "key" and second float value which are called
      "value".

Output:

    - Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Datum object.

=head3 Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::NeighborResult

If you want to use this package, all one need to do is write "use Jubatus::NearestNeighbor::Types;"

=head4 Functions

=head5 from_msgpack->($return_value_from_msgpack)

Input:

    - $return_value_from_msgpack is a array reference.

      This array reference certainly locate one of array reference. This
      reference are allowed to locate many array references. Each of located
      arrry references should have more than two values. First is string
      value which are called "id" and second is float value which are called
     "score".

Output:

    - A Array reference

      This array reference certainly locate one of array reference. This
      reference are allowed to locate many array references. Each of located
      arrry references should have two values. First is string value which
      are called "id" and second is float value which are called "score".
